Genesis test code

This repo contains all the test code I've written for my Genesis game.
The organization is pretty straight-forward; code is in folder "src", assets are in folder "res", and output is in folder "out".
LevelTutorial.cbp is the CodeBlocks project for everything. 
I'm using CodeBlocks with SGDK 1.31 as set up in the SDGK tutorial.

That said, I'm sure most of you just want to look at the ROM, which can be found in folder "out" titled rom.bin.
Simply run it in your favorite Genesis emulator (I use Fusion) to see the magic.

Find me on Twitter (@Borchmore) if you want to contact me or just check out my shitposts.
